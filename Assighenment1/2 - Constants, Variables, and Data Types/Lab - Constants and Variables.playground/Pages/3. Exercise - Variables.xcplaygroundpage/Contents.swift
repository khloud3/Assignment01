var schooling = 17
print("My total years of school i have completed" , +schooling)

//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling = 18
print ("My total years of school i have completed" , +schooling)

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("The frist time in constant we cannot change the value but in variable we can do it")
